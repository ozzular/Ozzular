I'm Peter — a junior web developer  enrolled in the ALX FE Prog, on a mission to build smart, intuitive products that make life simpler and financial opportunities more accessible.

💡 **Why tech?**  
I started this journey to design a tech-driven life, solve real problems around me, and eventually launch scalable startups blending **crypto, banking, and payments** for African markets.

🚀 **My focus:**  
- Master JavaScript, React, and modern UI/UX practices.
- Build real-world fintech and utility apps that can scale.
- Document every lesson — from API security to state management — as I go.
